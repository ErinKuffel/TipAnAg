## Notes

I struggled to research app building on the internet due to a lack of consistent internet access during this holiday break. So, for most trouble I ran into, I had spent hours trying to understand and fix the issue without help, though research would have tremendously sped up and improve the app building process. 
Once, I accidentally mislabeled a UI item and tried to change the coding back; that was an issue but I was able to fix it after a while. Adding the Settings screen was initially challenging because my Navigation Controller wasn't working.  Also, I tried to add a Text object in the Settings view so the user can create his/her own default tip percentage; I could not get the coding right.
